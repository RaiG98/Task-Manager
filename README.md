# Task-Manager
Keep track of the tasks assigned to each member of your team.
## More infomation about the programme:
This code defines a menu-based interface for a task management system. The system allows users to log in, register new users (if the user is an admin), add tasks, view all tasks, view and edit the tasks assigned to the current user, generate reports, and display statistics. The program uses a while loop to repeatedly present the menu options to the user and perform the corresponding actions based on their input. The program also includes error handling for invalid usernames and passwords, and for unauthorized access to certain features. The program exits when the user selects the 'e' option.

## How to use the programme:
1. Ensure the tasks.txt and the users.txt files are in the same directory as the task_manager.py file
1. Run task_manager.py
